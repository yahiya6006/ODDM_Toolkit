# About 

ODDM-Toolkit is a comprehensive data management tool designed for handling object detection datasets. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating projects, adding and managing datasets, and controlling user access with role-based permissions. Users can modify, review, and verify dataset updates through a structured task system. Once the data is finalized, it can be exported in various formats, including YOLO and Pascal VOC. The toolkit streamlines the entire dataset lifecycle, from organization to versioned releases, ensuring efficient and controlled dataset management.
